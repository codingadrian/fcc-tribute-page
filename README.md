# FreeCodeCamp - Tribute Page

This is my first project for the [FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org) develover path.

## Motivation for the project

I am looking to become a full stack developer and this is one of my first milestones to get there.

I had already submitted this project, but as I am taking this path full time now, I needed to be honest to myself, and understanding the code I write is part of that, therefore I wanted to refactor (more like rewrite) this page.

## Author

My name is Adrian Robles, I am a 32 y.o. Costa Rican. I am new to programming and by today (April 11th, 2019), I have only studied coding for 3 weeks.

## Goal

My goal is to complete the task, following the user stories required and passing all the tests.

I will apply as much knowledge as I have been able to gather.

## Achievements

I completed the challenge, just a very basic page. I focused on applying and modifying elements that I already new or understand and had more control of. I did not wish to be perfectionist, and I wanted to be based on something about me, about my interests.

## Resources

The resource that I use the most, and all the time is: [W3 Schools](http://w3schools.com/)

Obviously, I am also doing the challenges on FCC, which is linked above.
